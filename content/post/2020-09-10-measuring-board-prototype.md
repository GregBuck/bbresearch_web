In the fall of 2019 Roy Murray was contracted to develop the electronic components for a prototype fish measuring board. The imputus for this contract was the belief that a measuring board using commonly available electronic components could be developed that would be substantially cheaper and more rugged than the digital calipers currently used.

The specific requirements were:

-	Using an open source single board computer such as a Raspberry Pi or an open source microcontroller such as an Arduino, a device will be constructed that will transmit sex and length data to a Windows operating system via Bluetooth or directly by communications cable.

-	Two length sensors will be evaluated for the protoype.  One is a magnet-operated length sensor (EP-2 from MTS systems) and the other a touch-operated  linear potentiometer (Spectra Symbol ThinPot).  A single device will be constructed that can interface with either sensor for evaluation purposes.

-	System will operate on rechargeable battery power with minimum operating time before recharge of 6 hours at 35 degrees F.  Batteries will be recharged using off-the-shelf recharging hardware.

-	Sex data will be in numeric three digit code (1=male, 2=female, 3=unknown) and length data will be in millimeters with 1-2 mm of precision, measurable up to 1000mm.

-	Code written in Python for a Windows-based computer will be developed to receive and store transmitted fish data.

-	The device will be waterproof and sufficiently rugged to withstand the rigors of fieldwork. Design considerations will also include the goal of in-house maintenance and reproducibility.

-	At the end of this project an electronic schematic, parts list, and software along with any other design notes and/or drawings developed during this design process will be delivered to the state of Alaska along with any and all intellectual property rights.
