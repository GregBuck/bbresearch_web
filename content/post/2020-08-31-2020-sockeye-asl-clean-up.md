I did a little [review](https://rpubs.com/gbbuck/653228) of Stacy's ASL dataset. Had a little extra time last week so spent some time 
documenting and commenting on the code. Hopefully this will make this an learning document as much as a useful QA/QC document. I will 
go back through some of the code I've developed for some of the inseason tasks such as district run projections so that Stacy & Jordan
can study those files and thus be in a position to help with further development next spring.
