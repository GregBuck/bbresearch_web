Looks to me like we are about midway through a ~60 M run with more or less average run timing. This would be ~10 M over forecast. So far I see a couple of narratives forming around the 2021 run:

1. Epic Nushagak River run (new for this year)

2. Outsized age 1.2 returns (same as last year)

3. Small fish (same as last year)

(7/9/21 update)
4. a return to more normal run timing (?)
