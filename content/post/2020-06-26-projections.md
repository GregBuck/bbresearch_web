I will add districts once the total run reaches 200,000 in that district. I will update these projections daily.
I will update these projections through the peak of the run. After that point projecting entirely from historical 
data can be risky because at some point, usually late in the run the historical projection will diverge from the 
observed run on the ground in all but the most average of years. The trick is to project total run up until that 
point then direct your attention to facts on the ground.  Curry Cunningham and I had several conversations about 
an inseason projection model that would make use of observed run as well as historical runs and weight those two 
pieces of information based on where we throught we were in the run. Such a mixed model could be safely used for 
projections throughout the entire course of the run safely.
