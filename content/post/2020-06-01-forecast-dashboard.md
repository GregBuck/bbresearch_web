Over the past few years, research staff have been moving our forecast tools from outdated 
spreadsheets which are not very secure, can be prone to errors and very time consuming towards 
a system based on the statistical programming language R. The current iteration of this effort 
is an interactive application that makes use of the 'shiny' package. This version is still under 
construction but currently displays the selected data in table format nad as a scatterplot and 
a plot of the residuals. Currently the model output is fixed as the sibling model. Other 
models including time series models are planned. Link [here](https://gregbuck.shinyapps.io/forecast_shiny/).
