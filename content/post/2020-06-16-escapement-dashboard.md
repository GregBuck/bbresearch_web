This dashboard displays cumulative escapement by river with a black line. Upper and lower cumulative SEG goals with historic timing are displayed with a red dashed line. This dashboard is live as of 6/22/20 and will be updated daily. 

6/23 update: extend graphs X-axis through the date where cumulative historical proportion is < 0.95. Added tab for Kvichak (there is only one number so it doesn't display well at this point.)
