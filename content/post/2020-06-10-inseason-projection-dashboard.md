Example from last year [here](https://rpubs.com/gbbuck/627140).


Developments notes for later:

1. Convert to universal shiny app that would allow users to pick timing range, and years to include in historic dataset. 
2. Source file for district projections: 'DistrictInSeasonProjection.Rmd'
3. Source file for baywide projections: 'InSeasonProjection.Rmd'
