Things are a bit sluggish at this point with Nushagak shouldering the load at this point but the 300+ Pt Moller index that Scott highlighted the other day means that things should dramatically ramp up in ~5 days or so. Hopefully the eastside will get a reasonable chunk of those fish. So far I see three narratives around the 2021 run:

1. Epic Nushagak River run

2. Outsized age 1.2 returns (same as last year)

3. Small fish (same as last year)
