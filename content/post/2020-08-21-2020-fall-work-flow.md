Bristol Bay research staff has several workflows that are related to forecasts and escapement goal reviews that will require attention this fall. Several of these work flows (salmon forecast) have parts that need to be executed more or less in squence and involve a number of people who aren't formally on ADF&G Comm Fish research staff in order to get the forecast out the door on a timeline that the public has come to expect. In order to keep everyone on with a general understanding of the general timeline and who the lead is for each task, I've done some basic timelines for herring and salmon forecasts. I'll add escapement goal timelines once that ball gets rolling. I think I've had preliminary discussions with key personel involved and think these timelines should work. Once everyone gets back to Anchorage, research staff will have a quick meeting to make sure we are all on the same page. tentative timelines [here](https://rpubs.com/gbbuck/651371).
