This tracking dashboard queries the FDMS system and retrieves the age data from most recent 10 days and displays the data by
district in stacked bar graphs. Link [here](https://rpubs.com/gbbuck/624037).

Am working to display forecasted age composition and historic age composition for reference. This does NOT replace the 
periodic age compositions that Stacy puts out as those compositions are weighted. This is meant simply as a near real 
time look at the unweighted raw ASL data as it comes in to the FDMS.
