Bristol Bay research staff has several workflows that related to forecasts and escapement goal reviews that will require attention this fall. Several of these work flows (salmon forecast) have several parts that need to be executed more or less in squence and involve a number of people who aren't formally on ADF&G Comm Fish research staff in order to get hte forecast out the door on a timeline that the ppublic has come to expect. In order to keep everyone on track and understand the general timeline and who the lead personnel for each task are I've done some basic timelines for herring and salmon forecasts. I'll add escapement goal timelines once that ball gets rolling. I think I've had preliminary discussions with everyone involved with 2021 forecasts and think these timelines shoudl work. Once everyone gets back to Anchorage, research staff will have a quick meeting to make sure we are all on the same page. tentative timelines [here](https://rpubs.com/gbbuck/651371).
