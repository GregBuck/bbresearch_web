(7/15/21) With the dramatic drop off of the PMTF index last night it looks like we are in the late stages of a run that will be in the upper 60m range. This would be ~10 M over forecast. So far I see a couple of narratives forming around the 2021 run:

1. Epic Nushagak River run (new for this year)

2. Outsized age 1.2 returns (same as last year)

3. Small fish (same as last year)

(7/9/21 update)
4. a return to more normal run timing (?)

(7/15/21 update)
BBay, Ugashik and Nushagak projections are discontinued as we are at or near the top end of the historical dataset so projections beyond this point are going to be increasingly speculative and unlikely to be more informative than where we are at at this point. Other projections will continue to be updated daily.
